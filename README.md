# Login-Master
The goal of this project is to design and implement a Login Page with both login and sign-up functionalities, incorporating smooth animations and modern UI design principles. The project will use HTML for structure, CSS (Flexbox, transitions, keyframes) for styling and animations, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Key Features:
Responsive Layout:

The page will be designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks good on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
CSS Flexbox will be used to create a flexible and responsive layout.
Login and Sign-Up Forms:

The page will include two forms: one for login and one for sign-up.
These forms will be styled to match the modern UI design.
Smooth Animations:

CSS transitions will be used to add smooth animations when switching between the login and sign-up forms.
CSS keyframes will be employed to create more complex animations, such as form elements sliding in or out, or background elements moving.
Interactive Elements:

JavaScript will handle the interactivity, such as switching between the login and sign-up forms without reloading the page.
It will also validate the input fields, ensuring that users provide the correct information before submitting the form.
Styling Details:

The design will feature modern styling techniques, such as gradients, shadows, and hover effects.
The color scheme will be carefully selected to create a visually appealing and professional look.
Animations:

CSS Flexbox will be used to position the forms centrally on the page.
CSS transitions will create smooth hover effects on buttons and input fields.
CSS keyframes will animate the transitions between the login and sign-up forms, making the page feel dynamic and engaging.
Project Structure:
HTML (index.html):

Basic structure of the page, including form elements for login and sign-up.
Buttons to switch between forms.
Links for forgotten password and other options.
CSS (style.css):

Global styles for the page, including font choices and color schemes.
Flexbox layout to ensure the page is responsive.
Styles for the login and sign-up forms.
Animations using transitions and keyframes.
JavaScript (script.js):

Functionality to toggle between login and sign-up forms.
Input validation and error handling.
Dynamic form behavior based on user actions.
Outcome:
By the end of this project, we will be having a fully functional and visually appealing login page. Users will be able to smoothly switch between login and sign-up forms with engaging animations, and the page will be responsive across different devices.
